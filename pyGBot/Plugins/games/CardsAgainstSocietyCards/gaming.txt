#Black cards

#White cards
Sonic the Hedgehog.
The collective wail of every Magic player suddenly realizing that they've spent hundreds of dollars on pieces of cardboard.
Rolling a D to save a failing marriage.
Buying virtual clothes for a Sim family instead of real clothes for a real family.
A fully-dressed female videogame character.
Eating a pizza that's lying on the street to gain health.
Making up for years of shitty parenting with a PlayStation.
